# Directory Details Printer

The aim of this project was to create a command line function which could output the directories and files within a specified directory.

This is not meant to be especially good code, and realistically I should have done this in a scripting language as it is on the command line, but eh.

Usage is licensed under the License file.

Happy for anyone to PR/Issue etc. Constructive criticism is also appreciated.

To run the code the usage is `Usage: java -jar [PATH]directorydetails.jar [head directory]`
